# About
Space Fighter is a game that is similar to Galaxian, a fixed shooter arcade game where the player destroys waves of aliens. The game was developed as a part of my studies at the university so please, do not expect much quality.

The game is developed using the SDL 2 library on C++

In order to run the project in Debug configuration you would need to add runtime DLLs to the ```.exe``` file. You can find all the files necessary in ```Debug.7z``` archive located in the root folder.
